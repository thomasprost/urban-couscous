# Tips & Tricks for development

The point of this Repo is to compile some dev (mainly web) tips/knowledge
I discover and keep track of all of them at the same place.

Some tips might seem very obvious or dumb but it's always important to remember even simple things.
I work on many different technologies so sometimes I forget things.
