### Wordpress

#### Mobile Testing

For local testing (Wamp or other) on Mobile,

change localhost to ip_address in database wp_options -> siteurl & home

You can then check directly on mobile with ip:port/site and debug

#### Local Permalinks

It happens that on localhost after installing Wordpress, links don't work. 
Just go to settings -> permalinks and Save. That will rebuild them properly.
